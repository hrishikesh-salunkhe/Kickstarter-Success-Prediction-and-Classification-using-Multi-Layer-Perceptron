# Kickstarter-Success-Prediction-and-Classification-using-Multi-Layer-Perceptron

THIS PROJECT IS LIVE AT: http://hsalunkhe.pythonanywhere.com

DESCRIPTION:
Kickstarter is one of the leading crowdfunding platforms that helps entrepreneurs get funding from the people.
But every two out of three projects on Kickstarter fails to receive their funding goal till they reach their deadline.

So we are providing an interface for the entrepreneurs which provides them with:
1. Classification algorithm to determine whether the project is likely to succeed or fail.
2. Statistics using graphs and data visualizations for each and every attribute of the project.

Using this interface entrepreneurs can fine tune each and every parameter and increase the chances of success of projects that are likely to fail.

HOW TO RUN:
1. Download the "Kickstarter_Executable_Code" folder
2. Install all the python libraries mentioned in the "requirements.txt" file
3. Run "python -m flask run" in the command line
